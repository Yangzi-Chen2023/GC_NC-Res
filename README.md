# GC_NC-Res
This project consists of three parts: Random forest model for GC diagnosis and Predict the survival outcomes of GC patient using RSF method.

## Random forest model for GC diagnosis
We develop a Random forest model for GC diagnosis. You can get more details in GC_RandomForest directory.

## Predict the survival outcomes of GC patient using RSF method
This part includes custom codes to predict the survival outcomes of GC patients. We built a prediction model by using Random Survival Forests (RSF) method.
