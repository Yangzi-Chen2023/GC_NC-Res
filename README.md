# GC_NC-Res
This project consists of three parts: Random forest model for GC diagnosis and Predict the survival outcomes of GC patient using RSF method.

## Random forest model for GC diagnosis
We develop a Random forest model for GC diagnosis. You can get more details in GC_RandomForest directory.

## Predict the survival outcomes of GC patient using RSF method
This part includes custom codes to predict the survival outcomes of GC patients. We built a prediction model by using Random Survival Forests (RSF) method.

## Python packages
The following are the versions of Python packages:
- python=3.9.10
- numpy==1.26.4
- scikit-learn==1.0.2
- scikit-survival==0.17.0
- eli5==0.11.0
- pandas==2.1.0
